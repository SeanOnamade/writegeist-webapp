# Writegeist Web - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESSFUL

The application builds successfully and is ready for testing! Here's what you need to do:

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional (for enhanced features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_key
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

1. **Create Supabase Project**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. **Get Credentials**: Copy your project URL and anon key from Settings > API
3. **Run Migrations**: Use the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` to set up your database
4. **Set up Storage**: Create buckets for `audio`, `documents`, and `avatars`

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Basic Workflow Test

5. Use global search (Cmd/Ctrl+K) to find content
6. Try the AI chat assistant
7. Upload some documents

### Advanced Features Test
1. Test auto-save by writing and waiting 30 seconds
2. Drag and drop to reorder chapters
3. Use filters and search in all sections
4. Test responsive design on mobile
5. Try keyboard shortcuts throughout the app
